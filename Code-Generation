Here's a Python function named `multiply` that multiplies two numeric parameters:\n\n```python\ndef multiply(num1, num2):\n    return num1 * num2\n```\n\nYou can use this function by calling it and passing two numeric values as arguments. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = multiply(5, 10)\nprint(result)  # Output: 50\n```\n\nIn this example, the `multiply` function takes two parameters `num1` and `num2`, and returns their product."}]
