It involves the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, problem-solving, visual perception, and natural language processing. AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and general AI, which has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks."},{"role":"user","content":"How is it related to machine learning?"},{"role":"user","content":"Write three multiple choice questions based on the following text, indcating the correct answers.\n\nMost computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.*\n\n- Image classification involves training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents. For example, in a traffic monitoring solution you might use an image classification model to classify images based on the type of vehicle they contain, such as taxis, buses, cyclists, and so on.*\n\n- Object detection machine learning models are trained to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might use object detection to identify the location of different classes of vehicle.*\n\n- Semantic segmentation is an advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong. For example, a traffic monitoring solution might overlay traffic images with \"mask\" layers to highlight different vehicles using specific colors."},{"role":"assistant","content":"1.
